# Invoice Processing with RPA

# Project Summary 
This project aims to develop an automated invoice processing system leveraging Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies to streamline invoice management, reduce manual effort, and minimize errors. The system captures invoice images via a mobile application and validates the vendor against a predefined vendor list. Recognized vendorâ€™s invoices are uploaded to SharePoint and sent for further processing with OCR to extract data, while others are routed for approval before being processed further. This dual-path workflow ensures both speed and accuracy in handling invoices.

# Novelty of the Project
The novelty of this project lies in its innovative integration of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies within a seamless mobile application to revolutionize invoice processing. Unlike traditional methods, which are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors, our system leverages Microsoft Power Apps and Power Automate to automate the capture, validation, and processing of invoices. By incorporating  enhanced OCR capabilities, we ensure accurate data extraction and validation, drastically reducing processing time and errors. This project not only enhances operational efficiency but also sets a new standard for digital transformation in invoice management, paving the way for more intelligent and automated business processes.
